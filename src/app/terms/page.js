Severability\nIf any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original.\n\n### 14. Waiver\nOur failure to enforce any right or provision of these terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, unless expressly stated in writing by WELKER or Sunburn MGMT.\n\n### 15.

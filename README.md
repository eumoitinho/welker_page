## Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a 1998 United States copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). The DMCA also heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.

## Music Content Protection Laws

### United States

In the United States, music content is protected under Title 17 of the United States Code, which outlines the federal copyright law. This law grants authors and creators exclusive rights to their works, including the rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, and display their creations publicly. The DMCA further strengthens these protections in the digital realm by addressing issues such as digital rights management and the responsibilities of online service providers.

### Brazil

In Brazil, music content is protected under Law No. 9,610 of February 19, 1998, known as the "Lei de Direitos Autorais" (Copyright Law). This law provides authors with exclusive rights to their creations, including the rights to reproduce, distribute, and perform their works publicly. It also establishes moral rights, ensuring that authors can claim authorship and integrity of their works.
